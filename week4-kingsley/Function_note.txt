Function is a code snippet that could be called by others, or called by itself.


 There are Three Types of Futures.
. Named function: this is a function with a function name:
 (example) function foo()
 + the function has a name. "foo"

#. An anonymous function: this is a function without a function name. as the name implied.
example: function ()
+ here the function has no name.

. An inner function is a function inside another function
example: function Squares (a,b)
+ (square in this case) is a function inside another "function"

. An outer function: this is a function containing a function
   example: function addsquare (x)
+ "addsquare" is a function inside another function.

. A recursive function is a function that calls itself. See recursion
example, function loop(x)
+ Recursion is used to solve problems that contain smaller sub-problems.
  A recursive function can receive two inputs
 a base case (ends recursion) or a recursive case (continues recursion).
