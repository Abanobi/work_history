The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's
value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case,
 as well as statements in cases that follow the matching case.

 1. Using switch statement, what could happen if by mistake or intentionally the
 Break was omitted.
 the omitting of the break will run the script were the last criterial were met.
 then if the breaks was continued after being omitted, the other criterial will
 not be run.

example below...

const check = 10;
switch (check) {
  case -11:
    console.log('11');
    break;
  case 10: // check = 10 so criteria met here
    console.log(11);
    // NOTE: the forgotten break would have been here
  case 9:
  // no break statement in 'case 10:' so this case will run as well
    console.log(9);
    break; // it encounters this break so will not continue into 'case 2:'
  case 2:
    console.log(2);

// here the break stop after the case value Paul
. then the criterial was met.
before the case with the criterial was met.

2. Multi-case - single operation
This method takes advantage of the fact that if there is no break below
a case statement, it will continue to execute the next case statement
 regardless if the case meets the criteria.


var myName = 'kingsley';
switch(myName){
  case 'eugine':
    console.log("eugine is my name");
    break;
  case 'paul':
    console.log('paul is my name');
    break;
  case 'Abanobi':
  case 'kingsley':
  case 'Uzoma':
    console.log('Abanobi kingsley Uzoma is my name');

}
