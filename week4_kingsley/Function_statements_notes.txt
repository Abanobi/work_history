FUNCTION DECLARATION
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
•The name of the function.
•A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
•The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
The following code defines a simple function named  square:

For example,
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}

be anonymous; it does not have to have a name. For example,

 Defining the function simply names the function and specifies what to do when
 the function is called. Calling the function actually performs the specified
 actions with the indicated parameters.
For example, if you define the function square, you could call it as follows.
