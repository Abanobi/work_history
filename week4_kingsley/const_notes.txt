The const.
const is  a short name for constant in the javascrift,
you only add  the values that you don't want to changed or that will never change?

  for example const declaration
  const myName = 'kingsley';
  console.log(myname);// prints success.

  const myLocation = 'Nigeria';
  console.log(myLocation);
  // the output is Nigeria.

  = this is the assignment operator assigned to the value 'kingsley' to the valiable myName.

IF ELSE STATEMENT:
This is used to answer question that has multiple yes or No condition.

const moonPhase = 'solar eclipse';
if(moonPhase ==='full'){
console.log(how1);
} if else(moonPhase === 'mostly full');
